# Dmg calc
Weapon base is mark I. That base is a small number. If you increase mark, dmg goes up. Weapon rarity basically means you have more mods on your weapons.
For example, normal beam at mark XII does 500 dmg and at xv and 75 wep power does 1k dps. If you add 5 30% +dmg consoles and 5 dmg mods (10% +dmg each), 
that wep will do 200% more dmg, meaning 3k. If you also do surgical strikes III attack upgrade, for another 300%, it will do 6k. If you also do crit for 100%
it will be 800% +dmg on your 1k, meaning 9k dmg. If you also do haste 100%, it will be 18k. If you get 6 weps to do all that, it will be 108k. 
So, any single source of dmg is usually insufficient. At least get pets.

# Math
+dmg consoles * +bonus dmg/haste consoles * wpnpwr/acc/[dmg] mod/attack upgrade

# Pvp
Pvp relies on not being targeted by using intel team, sci stealth consoles, high defense value and surgical strikes for dmg. 
You may want to disable your enemy first with subnuke and holds. If everything fails, you can use high dmg clickies. You may want control immunity rep trait.
Use subnuke first, then holds, any weapon boosts, then SS III.

# How to play
Tanking: Tanking relies on pulling aggro to increase threat by shooting multiple targets, threatening stance cptn skill, then using strategist skill, hull image refractors console,
colony deflector to increase your hullcap, your crits, your dmg res and incoming heals

Support: Support relies on debuffing your enemies and healing others. Pets with tachyon beam like delta flyers are great

Damage: Dps relies on slotting as much as possible +dmg (cat1) +bonus dmg (crtd), final multipliers (attack upgrades), reducing cd and extending uptime of attack upgrades, haste and piloting

# Tips
If you get shot at, placate the target. 

Move as fast as you can by triggering your fortified engines with aux to sif, your conn officer from phoenix, epte and evasive maneouvers.

Your tac, sci and eng seat number 1 should have team power so you can clear debuffs (plus polarize hull).

Without subnuke, you will always be subpar in pvp.

Try to extend uptime and reduce cd of your attack upgrade, it is essential for high dps required for elite content.

Try not to double up on boff powers, or use two different attack patterns. 

Google each boff power on stowiki, and if it puts other skills on cd, don't use those other skills.

Accuracy is very much important, and so is haste. Sometimes only diff between you doing 100k dps and someone doing 300k is their max hit.

Avoid EPG builds unless you are in all EPG team because taking out enemy shields both brings dps, and if you don't take out their shields, makes your team job more difficult.

Get all reps maxed out even if you don't need the gear. They will appear in your passives and you may need the traits, ship modules and respecs.

Do all of R&D by doing 24h tasks. At level 15, they will give you nice traits and you'll be able to craft nice stuff.

Under HUD options, select maintain auto attack. Then turn off autofire on all your ship weps if you enabled it.

Assimilated module + Kinetic cutting beam will give set bonus which will help with your weapon energy drain.

# Space Keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as `Space.txt`. Then while you are in space in STO, type `/unbind_all` and then `/bind_load_file D:\Space.txt` (or the path where you saved the file). 
Assign your powers to tray 10, 9 8 and 7 and keep pressing spacebar during combat.

# Ground keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as Ground.txt. Then while you are on ground in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Ground.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your abilities to tray 2 and 3, make sure basic weapon fire is in default location (tray 1 slot 1) and keep pressing key 1 during combat. 
space is for jump and both mouse buttons for sprint.
