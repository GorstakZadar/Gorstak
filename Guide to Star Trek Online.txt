# Dmg calc
Weapon base is mark I. That base is a small number. If you increase mark, dmg goes up. Weapon rarity basically means you have more mods on your weapons.
For example, normal beam at mark XII does 500 dmg and at xv and 75 wep power does 1k dps. If you add 5 30% +dmg consoles and 5 dmg mods (10% +dmg each), 
that wep will do 200% more dmg, meaning 3k. If you also do surgical strikes III attack upgrade, for another 300%, it will do 6k. If you also do crit for 100%
it will be 800% +dmg on your 1k, meaning 9k dmg. If you also do haste 100%, it will be 18k. If you get 6 weps to do all that, it will be 108k. 
So, any single source of dmg is usually insufficient. At least get pets.

# Mechanics
Basically your wep hits their shields first. Any shield pen you might have will increase shield bleedthrough and apply dmg to hull which also has it's own resists.
Logic would suggest you want both pens and lorca console? Well, no. If you don't take out their shields, that means you made less dmg. And hull resists has diminishing returns,
meaning usually it's not greater than 50-60%, and your pen is useless. It is better to do additional crtd mod on your weps. 
If you can't heal dmg you receive you should reduce your threat, or use stealth. Nullifier stealth consoles will help and so will Intelligence Team.

# Pvp
Pvp relies on not being targeted by using intel team, sci stealth consoles, high defense value (slot aux to structural to trigger your engines) and surgical strikes for dmg. 
You may want to disable your enemy first with subnuke and holds. If everything fails, you can use high dmg clickies. You may want control immunity rep trait.
Use subnuke first, then forceful inspection, any weapon boosts, then SS III.

# How to play
Tanking: Tanking relies on pulling aggro to increase threat by shooting multiple targets, threatening stance cptn skill, then using strategist skill, hull image refractors console,
colony deflector to increase your hullcap, your crits, your dmg res and incoming heals
Support: Support relies on debuffing your enemies and healing others. Pets with tachyon beam like delta flyers are great
Damage: Dps relies on slotting as much as possible +dmg (cat1) +bonus dmg (crtd), final multipliers (attack upgrades), reducing cd and extending uptime of attack upgrades, haste and piloting

# Tips
Use as high as you can intelligence team, which will work with your stealth sci consoles to avoid being targeted. Forget resists, some people do so much dmg, you wont be able to tank.
If you do get shot at, placate the target. 
Move as fast as you can by triggering your fortified engines with aux to sif, your conn officer from phoenix and evasive maneouvers.
Your tac, sci and eng seat number 1 should have team power so you can clear debuffs (plus polarize hull).
Without subnuke, you will always be subpar in pvp.
Try to extend uptime and reduce cd of your attack upgrade, it is essential for high dps required for elite content.
Try not to double up on boff powers, or use two different attack patterns.
Crits are very much important, and so is haste. Sometimes only diff between you doing 100k dps and someone doing 300k is their max hit.
Avoid EPG builds unless you are in all EPG team because taking out enemy shields both brings dps, and if you don't take out their shields, makes your team job more difficult.
Get all reps maxed out even if you don't need the gear. They will appear in your passives.
Do all of R&D by doing 24h tasks. At level 15, they will give you nice traits.
Under HUD options, select maintain auto attack. Then turn off autofire on all your ship weps if you enabled it.
